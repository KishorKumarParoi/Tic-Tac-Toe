- I have 5 Features in my Tic-Tac-Toe App

1. For the current move only, showing “You are at move #…” instead of a button with Board[row][col]
2. Used two loops to make the squares calling dynamically instead of hardcoding them.
3. Added a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
4. When someone wins, highlighted the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
5. Displayed the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
